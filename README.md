## Compiling

Regardless of the size, complexity, and size of this plugin, the plug-in can still be easily compiled with a simple `make`.

### Requirements

- BZFlag 2.4.3+ (*latest version available on GitHub is recommended*)
- C++11
- JSON Library
    - libjson0-dev (Debian/Ubuntu)
    - json-c-devel (Fedora Linux)

### How to Compile

1. Check out the 2.4.x BZFlag source code from GitHub, if you do not already have it on your server. If you are still using SVN, it is recommended you switch to using Git because all future development of BZFlag will use Git.

        git clone -b 2.4 https://github.com/BZFlag-Dev/bzflag.git

2. Go into the newly checked out source code and then the plugins directory.
        
        cd bzflag/plugins

3. Run a git clone of this repository from within the plugins directory. This should have created a new `LeagueOverseer` directory within the plugins directory. Notice, you will be checking out the 'release' branch will always contain the latest release of the plugin to allow for easy updates. If you are running a test port and would like the latest development build, use the 'master' branch instead of 'release.'

        git clone -b release https://github.com/allejo/LeagueOverseer.git

4. Instruct the build system to generate a Makefile and then compile and install the plugin.

        cd ..; ./autogen.sh; ./configure --enable-custom-plugins=LeagueOverseer; make; make install;
